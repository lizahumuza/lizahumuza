### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Elizabeth Ahumuza!

I am from Uganda and i am a self taught full stack developer. I have a passion for creating user-friendly, scalable, and performant software that helps businesses and individuals achieve their goals. My skills include building modern front-end interfaces using React, managing server-side APIs using Node.js, and designing efficient databases with MongoDB.

Outside development, I'm a tech writer. I write short articles about programming and JavaScript in general.
